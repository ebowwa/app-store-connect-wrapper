## Bug Fixes Applied

Fixed naming conflict in `AppsAPI.get()` method that was overriding the base class method:
- Renamed `get()` to `get_app()` to avoid conflict with base class
- Updated method calls to use base class `get()` properly

## Verification

Tested connectivity with App Store Connect API:
- ✅ Client initialization successful
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Successfully retrieved 6 apps from the account

## Usage

To use the wrapper in other projects:

```bash
# Install with uv
uv pip install -e /Users/ebowwa/apps/app-store-connect-wrapper

# Or add to pyproject.toml dependencies
app-store-connect-wrapper = { path = "/Users/ebowwa/apps/app-store-connect-wrapper", develop = true }
```

## Security Notes

- `.env` file contains sensitive API credentials - keep secure
- `AuthKey_4U9JZZ86U8.p8` is the private key - never commit to version control
- Both files are properly listed in `.gitignore`
